        <p> A large number of tour operators around the world feature the Maltese Islands on their holiday brochures and online portfolios. So if you are planning a trip to Malta, Gozo or Comino, 
            it may be a good idea to check out what's on offer. Some of the companies listed on this site have been selling the destination for many years and can be considered to be experts in their field. 
            Others are relatively new to the Malta market and offer a fresh outlook on 
            what the islands have to offer. Some are general leisure operators, whilst others specialise in a particular activity such as pilgrim tours, student travel, weddings and honeymoons and so on.
